Hattastic Travel was a game that was supposedly "inspired" by A Hat In Time. Boy, I sure wonder where that name came from.

It had no story at the time, and it was cancelled.

However, this version I'm giving you is a remake of the original A Hattastic Travel, which I don't have currently (whoops)

This too had no story and was cancelled. However, it was made out of the corpse of the source code of the ORIGINAL VERSION OF SCOOTER SIMULATOR! It's changed so much that I doubt somebody could remake the original source code, but whatever.
