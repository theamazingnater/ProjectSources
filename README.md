# OldStuff
An repository for all of the old programs I wrote that are no longer being used, or programs that I wrote for fun and nothing else. Expect bad code, as some of these were written around 2019.

# How do I use these? This way of uploading files is confusing.
Usually a folder for a thing I made has an assembled version of it. Download that and insert it if you don't want to figure out how everything works.

# Things included:
Tiny ROBLOXian Clone Tool Remake
