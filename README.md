# Project Sources
An repository for all of the old programs I wrote that are no longer being used, or programs that I wrote for fun and nothing else. Expect bad code, as some of these were written around 2019.

# How do I use these? This way of uploading files is confusing.
Usually a folder for a thing I made has an assembled version of it. Download that and insert it if you don't want to figure out how everything works.

# What's this subfolder inside this folder with the same name as the main script only with a "scripts" next to it?
That right there is the scripts that goes inside the main script.

# Things included right now:
Tiny ROBLOXian Clone Tool Remake

Old version of SB64's engine

Old boss I made's source code

Scooter Simulator Remake I made as a birthday celebration's source code

NASU from Yume Nikki recreation's source code 

# Will this repository recieve any updates?

Definitely! Whenever I make something for fun or something becomes really old I'll put the source code here for you guys to enjoy.
